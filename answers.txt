Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows us to work locally on a shared project where we can each
have a local copy of the project and make edits/changes without changing the 
main project. After working locally Git also allows us to save all of our
changes and commit them to a shared final project. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: In cellular biology, oftentimes experimental results from sequencing
reactions involve large amounts of data, mostly base-pair data. With data
science it allow biologists to process and analyze this data to assess
success rates of reactions and also visualize sequencing data in a 
scientist-friendly manner. 

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging treats each new commit as a separate branch that is outside
the main branch. With rebasing, it takes commits and writes them over the
history as if there never was a branch off. 

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to learning more about how to use code to 
analyze data in ways that make it easy to observe trends and observations.
