Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: In cellular biology, oftentimes experimental results from sequencing
reactions involve large amounts of data, mostly base-pair data. With data
science it allow biologists to process and analyze this data to assess
success rates of reactions and also visualize sequencing data in a 
scientist-friendly manner.
